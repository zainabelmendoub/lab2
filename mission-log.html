            <h2>Axiom Mission 4</h2>
            <p>Shukla has been selected as the pilot for the upcoming Axiom Mission 4 to the International Space Station. He will join a crew led by commander Peggy Whitson and mission specialists Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski and Tibor Kapu. Fellow ISRO astronaut Prasanth Nair has been designated as the backup crew member; both underwent training at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston.

The mission, a collaboration between NASA, SpaceX, and ISRO, aims to strengthen international spaceflight cooperation. If successful, Shukla will become the first Indian astronaut to visit the ISS and the second Indian in orbit, after cosmonaut Rakesh Sharma. The cost of his seat is estimated in the “mid-$60-million range”</p>
